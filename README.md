# 🚀 Employee Management System

A full-featured **Employee Management System** built with **ReactJS**, using **Context API** and **LocalStorage** — no backend required!  
Designed for Admin and Employee roles with separate dashboards, task management, and role-based authentication simulation.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 **Authentication Simulation**  
  Admin and Employee login flow handled through Context API and LocalStorage.
  
- 🧠 **Context API**  
  - `AuthContext`: Manages authentication states (login, logout, current user role).
  - `TaskContext`: Manages task creation, assignment, and storage.

- 💾 **LocalStorage Persistence**  
  All data — including users, tasks, and auth session — are saved and loaded from the browser's local storage.

- 🖥️ **Separate Dashboards**  
  - **Admin Dashboard**: Manage employees and tasks.
  - **Employee Dashboard**: View and complete assigned tasks.

- ✍️ **Task Management**  
  - Admins can create, assign, and delete tasks.
  - Employees can view their assigned tasks.

- 🔄 **Dynamic Login/Logout**  
  Authenticated session stored persistently until logout.
